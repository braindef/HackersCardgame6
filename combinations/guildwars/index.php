<h1>GuildWars, or general MMORPG</h1>
<pre>Working through <a href="../../jpg/EN/">all the cards</a> may help to find out what went wrong.<br><br>
I should not have studied Computer Science and Psychology...

After i found out, about the <font color=red>technology cards (t1, t2, ...)</font> it was clear to me, that <font color=yellow>MMORPG</font>'s are
beeing used to programm bad <font color=yellow>stimulus-response-habits</font> (t11 card or more likely t2 or t7 card).

And then make the <font color=green>Kid</font> that plays the game <font color=red>kill an equal aged</font>. (= dt1 card). Of course a single kill
in the game will not kill a human in the real world, otherweise gamers would have wiped out our planet
a million times since there are billions of gamers with 10'000 game kills or more.
Normally they switch between "<font color=green>this is only game</font>" and "<font color=yellow>this will have impact on the real world</font>".

In a group they normally declare one kid (in this case me) to a "Rapist Terrorist" (m41 card) and make the others attack him / her (m37 card).
I tried to explain the problem to a friend (<font color=yellow size="6em">you</font>) but i guess <font color=red>they attacked him
with a card that goes against his <b>sexual integrity</b></font> (and maybe co6 card).
I guess this created <font color=yellow>avoidance behavior</font> that he does not listen to me. <s>They</s> I also asked his Sister to act,
but she did not answer. The last move they played against me was puting me again in a mental institution (m19 card),
for erasing my brain, <font color=red>making me forget about him</font>, continuing <s>train</s> manipulate him.

<font size="6em"><b>Sorry for that but it's not all my fault.</b></font>

but maybe i'm wrong that they would like to do evil things if you look at the last sentence of this article:
<font size="4em">https://wowwiki.fandom.com/de/wiki/<font color=cyan>Nachtwache</font></font> but gamers should know about the <font color=cyan size="8em">technology cards!!!</font>
